# react-effect-hook

The useEffect hook in React allows us to perform side effects in function components. Before the introduction of hooks, function components were limited to rendering JSX based on props and didn't have a way to handle side effects.

With the useEffect hook, we can execute JavaScript code after each render of the component. This opens up a range of possibilities, such as fetching data from a backend service, subscribing to data streams, managing timers and intervals, and interacting with the DOM.

There are three key moments when the useEffect hook can be utilized:

1. Mounting: When the component is first added to the DOM and renders. This is the initial rendering of the component.

2. Update: When the state or props of the component change, causing a re-render. This allows us to respond to changes in data and update the component accordingly.

3. Unmounting: When the component is removed from the DOM. This is an opportunity to clean up any resources or subscriptions that were created during the component's lifetime.

By using the useEffect hook, we can handle these key moments and perform side effects at the appropriate times. It provides a way to synchronize our component with the outside world and manage interactions that go beyond rendering JSX.

In addition to these key moments, useEffect also offers the ability to fine-tune its behavior by specifying dependencies or conditions that determine when the effect should be executed. This allows us to control exactly when the effect runs, optimizing performance and preventing unnecessary re-execution.

In summary, the useEffect hook is a powerful tool in React that enables us to perform side effects in function components. It provides flexibility in handling different stages of a component's lifecycle and allows us to synchronize our component with external data sources or manipulate the DOM.
